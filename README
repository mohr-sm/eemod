EEMOD version 1.0

EEMod is an "Essential Ecological Model" which contains a DNSMod ("Detailed 
Nitrogen SubModel") and a SEDSMod ("Sediment SubModel").

The main idea of this model is developing it in 3 levels of abstraction:

Level 0
=======

Different Fortran Modules are implemented containing data types, functions 
and subroutines.

In this way, people can simply use one of the methdos in their own models.


Level 1
=======

0-Dimensional model to run the model in a "reactor type" model. This model is 
implemented in Python and R. These enviroments will setup the input files, do 
the integration of the differential equations and plot the results. However, they
will use the modules developed at level 0.

This level is mainly for testing modifiactions in the model / code and to apply in 
0D- fully mixed models (reactors, shallow small lakes...)


Level 2
=======
Coupling the existing model as part of a 1D model. In this case the General Ocean
Turbulence Model (GOTM) has been choosen as 1D Hydrodynamic model. The FABM framework
will be use as interface to couple the EEMOD and the GOTM code.

In this level 2, the modules created in level 0 will be used and some additional files
will be added to couple the EEMOD to FABM



IMPORTANT
=========

The original version of EEMOD has been developed in the frame of the project NITROLIMIT
(www.nitrolimit.de) in the Institute of Hydrobiology of the TU-Dresden.

The original code of EEMOD and the different submodels (DNSMod, SedMod) is licensed by
the GPL License. 

These models are and will be always Open Source.
